**Here are some curated resources to supplement the material of this course:**

1. See this [survey paper](https://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2009-46-02/S0273-0979-09-01249-X/S0273-0979-09-01249-X.pdf) from Gunnar Carlsson for an overview of topological data analysis.
2. See these [lecture notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SCrKHfZdDuMmSKlZ7xveQT8SqBHjFEkk/view) from Tom Needham for a very detailed introduction to persistent homology.
3. The [JavaPlex tutorial](https://www.math.colostate.edu/~adams/research/javaplex_tutorial.pdf) by Henry Adams and Andrew Tausz is a great resource we will take advantage of in this course.
