I"Á<p>The goal for this course is for students to become proficient in techniques from topological data analysis. We will cover both theory and applications and topics such as constructing filtrations, clustering, persistent homology, mapper, and many more. Take a look at this <a href="https://youtu.be/Z_M8R88wjCo">introduction video</a> for a quick overview. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/TDA-and-Neuro/tda-and-neuro.github.io/blob/master/main.pdf">syllabus</a> for the course and here is an <a href="https://youtu.be/TlNVGFagPxU">introduction to the team</a>.</p>

<p>More in-depth details on course topics can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/TDA-and-Neuro/tda-and-neuro.github.io/blob/master/main.pdf">syllabus</a>. Communication outside of class time will function through the course gmail account, and the course Slack workspace (link to join). Exercises will be assigned via email and Slack, and updated in the Schedule section below, as well as in the Exercises folder.</p>
